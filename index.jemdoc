== About me
I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [https://ece.illinois.edu/ Depatrment of Electrical and Computer Engineering] at the [https://illinois.edu/ University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign] under the supervision of [http://publish.illinois.edu/milenkovic/ Prof. Olgica Milenkovic]. I received my M.S. in ECE from [https://illinois.edu/ University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign] in 2021. Previously, I graduated from [https://www.iitk.ac.in/ Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur] with a major in [https://www.iitk.ac.in/ee/ Electrical Engineering] and a minor in [https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/, Machine Learning] in 2018. 

== Research
My research interests lie broadly at the intersection of biology and mathematics. More specifically, I focus on applications of machine learning and big data to complex biological problems. My recent and ongoing projects include
- Combinatorial promoter methylation pattern analysis in cancer.
- Temporal and spatial charecterization of driver mutations in cancer.
- Small-sample estimation of support and distribution of mutations in viral genomes.
